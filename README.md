# Design Details:

__Initialize Services:__ First you have to initialize all APP42 Services that you are going to use in your application.

Initialization has been done in main.lua & App42APIServices.lua
```
App42API:initialize(Constant.apiKey,Constant.secretKey)
local userService = App42API:buildUserService()
local pushService = App42API:buildPushNotificationService()
local storageService = App42API:buildStorageService()

function App42CallBack:onSuccess(object)
  -- Handle here for response success
end
function App42CallBack:onException(exception)
	print("Message is : "..exception:getMessage())
	print("App Error code is : "..exception:getAppErrorCode())
	print("Http Error code is "..exception:getHttpErrorCode())
	print("Detail is : "..exception:getDetails())
end
```
__Register User:__ First register yourself using our User Service API.

 User registration has been done in App42APIServices.lua

```
local App42CallBack = {}
local userName = "Nick"
local password  = "******"
local emailId = "nick@shephertz.co.in"
userService:createUser(userName,password,emailId,App42CallBack)
```
__Authenticate User:__ If you already registered with App42 than use User Service API for authentication.

  User Authentication has been done in App42APIServices.lua

```
local userName = "Nick"
local password  = "******"
userService:authenticate(userName,password,App42CallBack)
```
__Push Service registration & Push Message :__ To get Push Notification you have to register your device on APP42 using PushNotification Service API.

Device Registration is done in App42APIServices.lua

```
require("App42-Lua-SDK.DeviceType")
local userName = "Nick"
local deviceToken = "<Your_device_token>"
local deviceType = DeviceType.ANDROID
pushService:storeDeviceToken(userName,deviceToken,deviceType,App42CallBack)
```

Send Message To User


```
local userName = "Nick"
local message = "<Your_message>"
pushService:sendPushMessageToUser(userName,message,App42CallBack)
```

__Create Game :__ To challenge your friend to play game with you, you have to create a game using our Storage Service API.


```
local dbName = "Your_data_base_name"
local collectionName = "Your_colllection_name"
local json = {}
json.gameName = "Tic_Tac_Toe"
json.gameId = "1234567"
json.next = "<Next_user>"
storageService:insertJSONDocument(dbName,collectionName, json,App42CallBack)  
```

__Update Game:__ While playing game , you have to use our Storage Service API to update the game.
 
Game updating has been done in App42APIServices.lua

```
local dbName = "Your_data_base_name"
local collectionName = "Your_colllection_name"
local key = "gameId"
local value = "1234567"
local json = {}
json.gameName = "Tic_Tac_Toe"
json.gameId = "1234567"
json.next = "<Next_user>"
storageService:updateDocumentByKeyValue(dbName,collectionName,key,value, json,App42CallBack)  
```
